"Interpretation and subsequent digitization of satellite imagery is a "
"rather laborious process. The use of AI-based image recognition "
"technologies leads to a reduction in labor costs and an increase in data "

"In the QGIS, the process of detecting objects of various types can be "
"automated using the Mapflow plugin. To accomplish this, you can follow "
"the steps described below."

"First of all, you have to install the plugin in QGIS. To do this, go to "
"the tab called Plugins -> Manage and Install Plugins, find Mapflow using "
"the search bar and click Install Plugin."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/userguides/qgis_plugin.rst:18
msgid ""
"After installation, the plugin icon will appear in the toolbar: "
"|plugin_icon|. Clicking on it will open the authorization window, in "
"which you need to click on \"Get token\"."

"A window will open in which you have to quickly and for free register on "
"`Mapflow.ai <https://app.mapflow.ai/>`_. After that, by clicking on the "

#: ../../source/userguides/qgis_plugin.rst:39
msgid ""
"By clicking on the \"Reset api token\" button, you will get access to the"

"Another way to log in to the plugin is using Oauth2. By checking the "

msgid ""
"Then, following the instructions, restart QGIS and click \"Log in\" "

"processing (Progress – 100%), after some time, you can load the result to"
" the map by clicking on \"View results\" (or double-clicking on the row)."
" The raster layer and the identified objects will be displayed on the "

"residential and purple is commercial)."

"Previously, we looked at one of the simplest scenarios for working with "
"the Mapflow plugin. However, its functionality is not limited to a single"
" data provider. In addition to the default providers, you can use the "
"search in the imagery catalog or process your own images. After adding "
"the image you are interested in to QGIS as a raster layer, you can select"
" it in the \"Data source\" field and run processing. The result can look "
"like this: the boundaries of trees of different heights, identified in "
"your image."

"In this quick tutorial, we looked at the main options for detecting "
"objects in remote sensing images with the help of the Mapflow plugin for "
"QGIS. In addition to buildings and forest vegetation, there are models "
"for recognizing roads or construction sites. A more extensive overview of"
" the plugin's capabilities, as well as various options for data sources, "
"are discussed in the documentation for :ref:`Mapflow <> QGIS`."
