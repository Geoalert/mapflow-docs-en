"The model is trained primarily for rural and suburban areas. Multi-task "
"learning is applied in order to improve the road mask connectivity, "
"especially in the spots obscured by trees or buildings. Best suited for "
"areas with low urbanization, and can fail in cities where wide roads with"
" sidewalks and complex crossroads are present. We extract the road "
"central line in order to decrease the clutter and optimize the extracted "
"road network, and then the road lines are inflated back to polygonal "
"object."
