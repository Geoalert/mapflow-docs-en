"Extracting of rooftops of buildings from imagery of high resolution. High"

"roofs. Three different models are used for different geographic regions "

"*Simplification* - the algorithm corrects the irregularities of the "
"contours of our model. The irregular geometries are replaced with "
"rectangles, circles or arbitary polygons with 90 degree angles, which "
"fits better to the original shape. Also the corrected buildings are "
"rotated to align with the nearest roads. This option produces much more "
"map-friendly shapes which look better and are easier to edit, but some "
"shape accuracy can be lost. See our `blog post <https://medium.com"

"*Merge with OSM [Mapflow Web only]* - some of the areas have great "
"coverage of OpenStreetMap data, and if you prefer human-annotated data, "
"you can select this option. In this case, we check for each building "
"whether it has a good corresponding object in OSM (Jaccard index more "
"than 0.7) and if there is one, we replace our result with OSM contour. "
"This makes the result not based on the image, so the buildings can be "
"shifted from actual positions, and some changes that have occurred after "
"OSM mapping may be lost."
