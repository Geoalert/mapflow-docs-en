"If you use Mapflow for agricultural landuse management, we suggest you "
"have a look at the methodology described below. It can help you "
"streamline the mapping process so you could focus on the end goal and "
"results instead. All you need is our QGIS plugin (a.k.a. Maflow for QGIS)"
" installed. If you haven't installed it yet, :doc:`here's "
"<../api/qgis_mapflow>` how you can do it."

"Before we begin, however: Mapflow will digitize the fields for you, but "
"the imagery for it to work on you need to select yourself. **We strongly "
"recommend you preview images before processing them** because their "
"quality may vary. Ones with high cloud cover (including cloud shadows) or"
" no-data pixels in the AOI will likely produce poor results. Here are "
"examples of two images that will inevitably yield unsatisfactory results:"
