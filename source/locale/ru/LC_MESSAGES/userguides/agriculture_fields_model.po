"Model for fields segmentation allows to detect the agricultural fields "
"and delineate the nearby fields from each other, if there is a visual "
"boundary (forest line, road, different crop stage). The model is trained "
"on the high resolution data (1-1.2 m), primarily for Europe, Russia. It "
"performs better with larger fields with active vegetation. Smaller and "
"terrace fields (typical for Asia) are delineated not so good. Fields "
"without vegetation, especially in winter period, are not target class."
