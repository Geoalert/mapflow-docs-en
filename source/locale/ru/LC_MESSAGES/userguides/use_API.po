"In case you have multiple polygons to process or update, it can be boring"
" to upload them one by one using Web or GIS user tools. In this case, "
"you'd better think of using Mapflow :ref:`Processing API`. In this "
"example let's assume we have a list of polygons indicating the populated "
"places borders and we want to extract features like \"buildings\" with "
"Mapflow processing API."

"1. To make it more realistic let's download some populated places borders"
" for the sample area in Uzbekistan using Openstreetmap. To do this we can"
" make a query with Overpass Turbo API like this: We can use QuickOSM "
"plugin in QGIS which is very friendly when it comes to downloading a "
"managable volume of data from Openstreetmap."
