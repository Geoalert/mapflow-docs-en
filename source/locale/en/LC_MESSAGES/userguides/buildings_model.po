"**Simplification** - the algorithm corrects the irregularities of the "
"contours of our model. The irregular geometries are replaced with "
"rectangles, circles or arbitary polygons with 90 degree angles, which "
"fits better to the original shape. Also the corrected buildings are "
"rotated to align with the nearest roads. This option produces much more "
"map-friendly shapes which look better and are easier to edit, but some "
"shape accuracy can be lost."
