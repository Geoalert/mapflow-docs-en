"the Mapflow plugin. However, its functionality is not limited to a single"
" data provider. In addition to the default providers, you can use the "
"search in the imagery catalog or process your own images. After adding "
"the image you are interested in to QGIS as a raster layer, you can select"
" it in the \"Data source\" field and run processing. The result can look "
