üèò High-density housing (Mapflow Web)
-------------------------------------------

Our ‚Äúhigh-density housing‚Äù AI model is designed for areas with terraced or otherwise densely built buildings, common in the Middle East, parts of Africa, etc. This model, just like the regular building model, detects the building roofs.

Firstly, the building blocks are segmented as a whole, and then each block is divided into individual houses with rectangular grid or Voronoi diagram, based on the detected individual roof markers.
