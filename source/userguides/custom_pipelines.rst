Custom Models
==================

There are several options of model customization in Mapflow. 

1. You request access to a specific model based on your use case and data, and we train it for you and connect it to Mapflow.

2. You choose one of the pre-trained models that are not included in the standard Mapflow pipelines and test it with your data or on your area to decide if it's applicable or requires additional training.

3. You train your own model with custom data and request our support to connect it to your account to leverage your model with the Mapflow workflow engine.

Below is the list of custom models created for specific use cases and available in Mapflow by request (to be updated).
