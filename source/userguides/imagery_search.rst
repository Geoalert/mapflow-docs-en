Imagery search
================

"Imagery search" allows Mapflow users to search for available satellite imagery over their area of analysis.
It's powered by Mapflow API providing access to the global satellite data providers and partners. 

Imagery providers available for the search and ordering:
    * ORBVIEW (aggregates and provides satellite imagery from the leading Chinese satellite operators)

Imagery providers supported for the account-based integration:
    * ArcGIS Worldview
    * :ref:`Maxar secureWatch / MGP <Maxar SecureWatch>`

.. note::

To start the processing using the Imagery Search data, you must:

1. Select a date range or a specific date;
2. Set the search parameters (Clouds, Off-Nadir, AOI/Scene intersection);
3. Apply provider filters:

    - "Mosaic" (Global mosaic 2022, ArcGIS World Imagery)
    - "Image" (Orbview)
    - "Available for me" - The search results will show only those providers that are connected to your account.

.. note::
    Filters and search parameters also work in real time for the list of images; for example, you can hide all images from the table or filter only the results from the providers that are available for you.

4. After clicking "Search Image", a table with search results and images extents will appear:

.. figure:: _static/historical_data_images.png

  :align: center
  :width: 16cm
  :class: with-border

|

5. You can sort, enable or disable images on the map, and preview them if the provider supports this feature (The preview will be automatically added to the map after selecting the image in the table);

.. image:: _static/search_table.png

  :class: with-border no-scaled-link

6. At the final step, you need to select the desired image by clicking on it in the table and click "Save". Now you are ready to start processing!

Schedule your search
---------------------

If you are not satisfied with the current search results or you want to get new images without repeating the search manually, the search scheduling will help.

How to create a scheduled search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Set the required search criteria and click "Search Imagery"

.. figure:: _static/templates_params.png

  :width: 13cm
  :class: with-border

|

.. note::
  If the total area of your search area exceeds 250 km¬≤, when you click on "Search Imagery" instead of an immediate search, you will be prompted to create a postponed background search.

       :width: 9cm
       :class: with-border

2. After that, the search results will appear and the "Save as schedule" button will be available

.. figure:: _static/templates_save_button.png

3. When you click on it, you will be prompted to choose the name of this search schedule

4. After creation the search will complete after a while and the search results will be available to you using "View on the map" button

Viewing background search results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now a background search will be launched on our side with a certain frequency and you will be notified when new images arrive.

.. figure:: _static/templates_new_images.png
  :alt: Templates new images
  :align: center
  :width: 13cm
  :class: with-border

  The search card shows the number of new images found in the background. Clicking on an image in the results table will mark it as "seen".

.. note::
  To start processing based on the found image you need to select the desired image by clicking on it in the table and click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù.

Two key points on viewing results:

- When opening the search, you will see **all** results found for the given area(s)
- If your search consists of multiple AOIs and you're interested in specific ones, you can select them in the "Upload GeoJSON or GeoTIFF file..." section ‚Üí Now results will only be displayed for the selected AOIs

Main operations with Search Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Source details** - Here you can view and download the geometry of your search
- **Mark all as seen** - If you have a lot of unread images, you can mark them as viewed all at once
- **Set Active Until** - You can change the lifetime of the background search (6 months by default at creation)

.. figure:: _static/templates_active_until.png

  After expired, the Search Template will not be deleted, but paused

- **Pause/Resume Template** - The pause means that there will be no background search for your template, but you can still view its results
- **Delete** - Permanently deletes the search template

You can also change the search criteria:

"View on the map" ‚Üí Adjust the search parameters ‚Üí "Search Imagery" ‚Üí "Save as schedule" ‚Üí Do not change the name and click "Schedule". Now the background search will work according to the new parameters.

Using Mapflow Imagery Search in QGIS
--------------------------------------

1. Switch to the tab "Imagery Search". To start the search, set the dates and the product type filters ("Mosaic" ‚Äì Imagery basemaps like ArcGIS or Global mosaic and/or "Images" - Satellite imagery archives)
2. Set additional filters like a minimum intersection with your area of analysis.
3. If there is non-empty response, it will add the **üîé Imagery Search metadata** layer to your QGIS project. You can select one or multiple results in the table - or use the layer's attribute table to start the analysis and processing with Mapflow models.

.. hint::
    In the Arcgis search results you see the zoom level at which the mosaic is available over you area. You can configure the table columns in the Settings.
