.. _Buildings model:

üè† Buildings
------------

Extracting of rooftops of buildings from imagery of high resolution.
High performance deep learning model is trained to detect the buildings roofs.

*Note:* The building predictions with area less than 20 sq.m. are removed to avoid clutter

The model does not extract the footprints directly, because they are not clearly visible in the images, but it can obtain them, just like human cartographers, by moving the roof to the bottom of the wall (see Additional options).

**Additional options:**

* **Classification by types of buildings** ‚Äì typology of buildings is represented by the main classes (see :doc:`reference <../../um/classes>`).
* **Simplification** - the algorithm corrects the irregularities of the contours of our model. The irregular geometries are replaced with rectangles, circles or arbitary polygons with 90 degree angles, which fits better to the original shape. Also the corrected buildings are rotated to align with the nearest roads. This option produces much more map-friendly shapes which look better and are easier to edit, but some shape accuracy can be lost.
* **Merge with OSM [Mapflow Web only]** - some of the areas have great coverage of OpenStreetMap data, and if you prefer human-annotated data, you can select this option. In this case, we check for each building whether it has a good corresponding object in OSM (Jaccard index more than 0.7) and if there is one, we replace our result with OSM contour. This makes the result not based on the image, so the buildings can be shifted from actual positions, and some changes that have occurred after OSM mapping may be lost.
* **Height Estimation (beta)** ‚Äì feature leverages a dedicated regression-based model that infers height using visual indicators such as shadow length and visible wall segments. The result is what is termed **3D building footprints** where the building's countour is projected to ground level instead of the roof outline. This is especially useful for oblique imagery, where roofs often appear shifted.

   Result without postprocessing: irregular building shapes, but best fit to the actual rooftop contour seen in the image.

   Result with simplification: most of the buildings become rectangular.

   Result merged with OSM: some of the buildings imported from OSM have more accurate shape, but may be shifted from the image position.
