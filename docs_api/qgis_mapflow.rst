How to use other imagery services
------------------------------------

You can enter your custom imagery source URL in one of the following formats:

* XYZ
* TMS
* WMS

All formats represent the most widely used protocols to fetch gereferenced imagery via http:
(There is one more type that is supported in the Mapflow which is *quadkey*)


How to process your own imagery data
------------------------------------

You can upload your local raster in GeoTIF format (*Open new .tif*). Every file added as raster layer into QGIS is visible in the drop-down list and can be selected for uploading.
